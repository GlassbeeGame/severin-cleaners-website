### SECTION 6: ADD 9th FAQ (180 words)

**Question:** "Why does it matter that Severin Cleaners is headquartered in La Mesa?"

**Answer (180 words):**

Our La Mesa headquarters at 8900 Grossmont Blvd provides significant advantages for customers throughout East County. Response time is the most immediate benefit—our crews start their day from La Mesa, meaning we can arrive at your property within 1-2 hours rather than the 2-4 hours required by companies driving from North County, Carlsbad, or downtown San Diego. This proximity enables genuine same-day service when you call before noon, not just theoretical same-day availability that depends on schedule gaps.

Operating costs are lower because we're not driving 30-40 miles each direction to reach East County properties, and we pass those savings to customers through competitive pricing without travel surcharges. Local knowledge matters significantly in La Mesa—our crews navigate Mount Helix's steep hillside roads daily, understand La Mesa Village parking logistics intimately, and know exactly which streets have width restrictions or access challenges. We're invested in this community as residents and business owners, not an outside company making occasional trips into the area. When you hire Severin Cleaners, you're supporting a true La Mesa local business headquartered in your community.
