## READABILITY ISSUES TO FIX

### FAQ Readability Problems

Several FAQ answers have sentences that are TOO LONG (40-60+ words):

**FAQ #2 (Same-Day):**
- 56-word sentence about time-sensitive needs - break into 3-4 sentences

**FAQ #3 (Areas Served):**
- Multiple 35-40+ word sentences - needs better flow

**FAQ #7 (Free Estimates):**
- 58-word sentence about on-site estimates - way too long

**SOLUTION:** Break all 35+ word sentences into 15-25 word sentences while maintaining information
