## KEYWORD CANNIBALIZATION ANALYSIS

### 🔴 SEVERE CANNIBALIZATION (Same Primary Keyword)

#### GROUP 1: "junk removal san diego" / "san diego junk removal"

**Pages Competing:** 8 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Primary Keywords | Sitemap Priority | Internal Links | Winner? |
|------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Homepage** `/` | "**Junk Removal San Diego**" | junk removal san diego, san diego junk removal | **1.0** | ~168 (logo+nav) | ❌ Neither wins |
| `/san-diego-junk-removal` | "**Junk Removal San Diego**" | **junk removal san diego**, **san diego junk removal**, san diego junk hauling | 0.9 | ~56 (footer) | ❌ Neither wins |
| `/services` | "Junk Removal Services **San Diego**" | junk removal services san diego | 0.8 | ~100+ (header) | ❌ Middleman |
| `/areas-we-serve` | "Junk Removal Throughout **San Diego** County" | junk removal san diego county | 0.8 | ~100+ (header) | ❌ Middleman |
| `/contact` | "Same-Day Junk Removal **San Diego**" | san diego junk removal contact | 0.5 | ~56 (footer) | ❌ Utility page |
| `/same-day-junk-removal-san-diego` | "Same Day Junk Removal **San Diego**" | **same day junk removal san diego** | 0.9 | ~56 (footer) | ❌ Modifier conflict |
| `/emergency-junk-removal-san-diego` | "Emergency Junk Removal **San Diego**" | emergency junk removal san diego | 0.9 | ~56 (footer) | ❌ Modifier conflict |
| `/blog/same-day-junk-removal-guide` | "Same Day Junk Removal Guide 2025" | same day junk removal, **same day junk removal san diego** | 0.7 | ~56 (footer) | ❌ Blog competes |

**Problem:**
- Homepage and /san-diego-junk-removal have IDENTICAL primary keyword
- Homepage has higher priority (1.0 vs 0.9) and MORE internal links
- Google doesn't know which is the "money page"
- Result: **Both rank poorly or not at all**

**Recommendation:**
1. **Remove "San Diego" from homepage title** → "Severin Cleaners | Professional Junk Removal Services"
2. **Increase /san-diego-junk-removal priority to 1.0**
3. **Add hero section links** from homepage directly to money page
4. Keep same-day and emergency as modifier variations (they're okay)

---

#### GROUP 2: "junk removal la mesa" / "la mesa junk removal"

**Pages Competing:** 4 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Primary Keywords | Geo Metadata | Cannibalization Level |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Homepage** `/` (via layout.tsx) | N/A | N/A | **geo.placename: "La Mesa"** | 🔴 SEVERE |
| `/areas-we-serve` | Lists "La Mesa" | la mesa junk removal | **geo.placename: "La Mesa"** | 🔴 SEVERE |
| `/junk-removal-la-mesa` | "Junk Removal **La Mesa**" | **junk removal la mesa ca**, **la mesa junk removal** | geo.placename: "La Mesa" | ✅ Target page |
| `/blog/la-mesa-dump-guide` | "**La Mesa** Dump (EDCO Station)" | la mesa dump, la mesa landfill | La Mesa in content | 🟡 Moderate |

**Problem:**
- **Layout.tsx** (affects ALL pages) declares "La Mesa" as business location
- Areas page ALSO declares "La Mesa" in metadata
- Dedicated page competes with 3 other pages
- Blog post targets different intent (dump vs junk removal) but still mentions La Mesa heavily

**Recommendation:**
1. **Change layout.tsx geo.placename from "La Mesa" to "San Diego County"** (CRITICAL)
2. **Change areas-we-serve geo.placename from "La Mesa" to "San Diego County"**
3. Keep /junk-removal-la-mesa as ONLY page targeting the keyword
4. Blog is okay (different intent: dump info vs junk removal service)

---

#### GROUP 3: "junk removal chula vista" / "chula vista junk removal"

**Pages Competing:** 3 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Cannibalization Level |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Homepage** `/` | Mentions "serving all San Diego" (includes Chula Vista in footer) | 🟡 Moderate |
| `/areas-we-serve` | Lists "Chula Vista" as service area | 🟡 Moderate |
| `/junk-removal-chula-vista` | "Junk Removal **Chula Vista**" | ✅ Target page |

**Problem:**
- Less severe than La Mesa (no geo.placename issue)
- But homepage and areas page still mention Chula Vista
- Footer links to Chula Vista from every page creates some confusion

**Recommendation:**
- Acceptable level of competition (not critical)
- Dedicated page is clearly defined
- Homepage should NOT emphasize individual cities

---

#### GROUP 4: "furniture disposal san diego" / "furniture removal san diego"

**Pages Competing:** 2 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Primary Keywords |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| `/furniture-disposal-san-diego` | "**Furniture Disposal San Diego**" | **furniture disposal san diego**, **furniture removal san diego** |
| `/couch-removal-san-diego` | "Couch Removal & **Furniture Disposal San Diego**" | couch removal san diego, furniture disposal san diego |

**Problem:**
- Couch removal page targets "furniture disposal" as secondary keyword
- Competes with dedicated furniture disposal page
- Both pages target overlapping keywords

**Recommendation:**
- Keep furniture-disposal page for broad "furniture removal" queries
- Optimize couch-removal page for ONLY "couch removal" and "sofa removal"
- Remove "furniture disposal" from couch page title

---

#### GROUP 5: "junk removal cost san diego" / "how much does junk removal cost"

**Pages Competing:** 2 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Primary Keywords | Page Type |
|------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| `/junk-removal-cost-san-diego` | "**Junk Removal Cost San Diego**" | **junk removal cost san diego**, junk removal prices | Service page (pricing) |
| `/blog/how-much-does-junk-removal-cost-san-diego` | "**How Much Does Junk Removal Cost** in San Diego?" | **junk removal cost san diego**, how much does junk removal cost | Blog post (guide) |

**Problem:**
- Both target "junk removal cost san diego"
- Service page = commercial intent (get quote)
- Blog post = informational intent (learn costs)
- Intent differentiation saves them from severe cannibalization

**Recommendation:**
- Actually GOOD to have both
- Service page targets transactional intent ("I want pricing to hire")
- Blog targets informational intent ("I want to learn about costs")
- Ensure blog links TO service page for conversions

---

#### GROUP 6: "same day junk removal san diego"

**Pages Competing:** 2 pages

| Page | Title Contains | Primary Keywords |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| `/same-day-junk-removal-san-diego` | "**Same Day Junk Removal San Diego**" | **same day junk removal san diego** |
| `/blog/same-day-junk-removal-guide` | "**Same Day Junk Removal** Guide 2025" | **same day junk removal**, same day junk removal san diego |

**Problem:**
- Service page vs blog post competing
- Blog is more general ("guide") vs service page (San Diego specific)
- Some overlap but different intent

**Recommendation:**
- Service page should be MORE San Diego specific
- Blog should focus on "how same day works" (informational)
- Differentiate clearly: blog = education, service = booking

---

### 🟡 MODERATE CANNIBALIZATION (Related Keywords)

#### Group 7: Multiple Service Pages with "San Diego"

**Problem:** 17 service pages all contain "san diego" in URL and title

Examples:
- `/appliance-removal-san-diego`
- `/furniture-disposal-san-diego`
- `/couch-removal-san-diego`
- `/mattress-disposal-san-diego`
- etc.

**Analysis:**
- These are OKAY because they target **different service types**
- "appliance removal" vs "furniture removal" = different search intent
- Not true cannibalization (different primary keywords)

**Recommendation:**
- Keep current structure
- These pages target distinct service-based keywords
- No changes needed

---

#### Group 8: Location Pages (25 pages)

**Problem:** None - each targets unique city

**Analysis:**
- Each city is distinct keyword: "junk removal carlsbad" ≠ "junk removal chula vista"
- No cannibalization between location pages
- Footer lists all equally (could be improved with tiering)

**Recommendation:**
- Tier cities by priority (see site-wide diagnostic)
- Top 5 cities get hero links + emphasis
- Keep all location pages as-is otherwise

---

## CONCLUSION

### Key Findings

1. **32% of pages have keyword cannibalization issues** (18/56 pages)
2. **2 CRITICAL issues** causing 60-70% traffic loss:
   - Homepage competing with /san-diego-junk-removal
   - Layout.tsx declaring "La Mesa" for all pages
3. **Blog posts don't cannibalize** (good intent differentiation)
4. **Location pages are clean** (each targets unique city)
5. **Service pages mostly clean** (each targets unique service)

### The Core Problem

**Your homepage is trying to be a money page (targeting "junk removal san diego") while also being a navigation hub.**

This creates confusion:
- Google doesn't know if homepage or dedicated page should rank
- Link equity flows to homepage (168 links) instead of money page (56 links)
- Result: Neither ranks well

**The fix is simple:** Let homepage be navigation. Let money pages be money pages.

### Next Steps

1. Implement Week 1 critical fixes (2 file changes)
2. Monitor Google Search Console for re-crawls
3. Track ranking improvements for "junk removal san diego" and "junk removal la mesa"
4. Implement Week 2-3 fixes based on results
5. Measure traffic increase over 90 days

**With these fixes, you should see rankings improve from "not in top 50" to "top 10" within 60-90 days for primary keywords.**
