</a>
```

   ```tsx
   className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline font-semibold"

   className="text-white hover:underline"
   ```

### Link Structure Validation:

- ✅ No inline styles - all styling via className
- ✅ Mobile-friendly touch targets (proper spacing)

| Junk Removal Cost | ~1,500 | 22 | 1.5% | ✅ Optimal |
| Estate Cleanout | ~1,200 | 16 | 1.3% | ✅ Optimal |
