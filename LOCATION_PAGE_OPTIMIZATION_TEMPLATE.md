# Location Page Optimization Template

## Prompt: Optimize [City] Location Page for Readability & SEO

Audit and optimize the `/junk-removal-[city]/page.tsx` file with these requirements:

---

## 1. Initial Analysis (DO THIS FIRST)

Before making any changes:

1. **Analyze the page** to identify current target keywords from:
   - Page metadata (title, description, keywords array)
   - H1 and H2 headers
   - Current keyword usage patterns

2. **Count current metrics:**
   - Total word count
   - Primary keyword mentions and density
   - Secondary keyword mentions

3. **Identify 1-3 unique city characteristics** currently highlighted (hillside terrain, major employer, downtown district, coastal properties, etc.)

4. **Present findings and get approval:**
   - "I found these target keywords: [list with estimated search volume if available]"
   - "Current word count: X words"
   - "Current keyword density: X%"
   - "Unique city characteristics: [list]"
   - "Here's what I plan to remove: [list sections with word counts]"

5. **Wait for approval before proceeding**

---

## 2. Word Count Target: 2,000-2,500 words

- Current pages are 5,000-6,200 words
- Our successful blog posts are only 2,500 words
- Reduce total word count by ~60% while keeping location-specific value

---

## 3. Keyword Optimization (After Identification)

**Requirements:**
- Overall keyword density: **1.0-1.3%** for city name mentions
- Primary keyword: **8-12 mentions** (exact-match phrase)
- Secondary keyword: **5-8 mentions** (exact-match phrase)
- Natural, readable integration - NO keyword stuffing
- Strategic placement in: H1, H2, opening paragraph, 1-2 H3s, 1 FAQ question

---

## 4. What to KEEP (Location-Specific Content)

✅ **Keep these sections (condensed):**

- **City-specific intro** (150 words max)
- **Fast response from local HQ** (80 words max)
- **Neighborhoods served** (bullet list, 40 words)
- **1-3 unique city characteristics** (50-60 words each) - Examples:
  - Hillside/terrain specialists
  - Coastal/beach properties
  - Major employer district (hospital, university, business park)
  - Downtown/village/historic district
  - Military base proximity
  - Border location challenges
- **Weather considerations** (40 words) - heat, rain, terrain challenges specific to this city
- **Major landmarks** (bullet list only, 30 words)
- **Services we remove** (with links to service pages, 200 words)
- **Why choose us** (4 bullet points, 80 words)
- **8-10 FAQs with SHORT answers** (2-4 sentences each)

---

## 5. What to CUT (Generic/Repetitive Content)

❌ **Remove these sections completely:**

- Major Streets & Access Routes
- Traffic Patterns & Service Timing (detailed)
- DIY vs. Professional Comparison
- "Dump Alternative" standalone section
- "How It Works" standalone section (it's in FAQs)
- Over-detailed neighborhood descriptions with paragraphs
- Repetitive "why choose us" content identical across pages
- Case study examples
- Multiple paragraphs explaining the same concept

---

## 6. FAQ Structure

**Requirements:**
- **8-10 questions** (comprehensive topic coverage)
- **Answers: 2-4 sentences each** (40-60 words max per answer)
- Must include location-specific FAQs like:
  - Pricing
  - Unique city challenges (terrain, access, parking, etc.)
  - Response time
  - Areas served
  - Eco-friendly practices
  - Free estimates
  - Furniture/appliance removal
  - Why local HQ matters
  - Any specific neighborhood or property type questions

---

## 7. Readability Requirements

- Natural, conversational tone
- NO awkward keyword stuffing like "our [city] junk removal team"
- Use keywords naturally: "Looking for junk removal [City] CA residents can trust?"
- Avoid repeating city name in every sentence
- Use pronouns, regional terms ("the area", "downtown", "locally"), "we", "our team"
- After establishing context, can use "the city" or specific neighborhood names instead of full city name

---

## 8. Process

1. **Analyze page and identify keywords** (see step 1 above)
2. **Present findings and wait for approval**
3. **After approval:** Make the edits
4. **Final verification:** Count word count, keyword mentions, density
5. **Commit with proper message format**

---

## 9. Constraints

- Keep word count between 2,000-2,500 words
- Maintain all location-specific differentiators unique to this city
- Don't remove unique local value (landmarks, weather, major employers, neighborhoods)
- Ensure keywords read naturally
- Each FAQ answer must be 2-4 sentences maximum
- Final content must be scannable and easy to read
