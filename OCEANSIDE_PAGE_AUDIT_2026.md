### 5. FAQ ANALYSIS - ⚠️ CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY (Grade: B+)

#### Current FAQs (5 total):

| # | Question | Answer Length | Quality |
|---|----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | How much does junk removal cost in Oceanside? | 150 words | ✅ Excellent |
| 2 | Do you provide junk removal for Camp Pendleton military housing? | 180 words | ✅ Excellent |
| 3 | Can you handle same-day junk pickup for vacation rentals? | 140 words | ✅ Excellent |
| 4 | Do you offer coastal property cleanouts and storm debris removal? | **38 words** | ❌ **TOO SHORT** |
| 5 | Are your junk removal services eco-friendly in North County? | 160 words | ✅ Good |

**Critical Issue: FAQ #4 is dramatically underperforming**

**Current Answer:**
> "Yes, while we're a general junk removal Oceanside company serving all types of properties, we excel at coastal property cleanouts including storm debris removal, salt air damaged furniture disposal, and beach equipment cleanup."

**Problems:**
- Only 38 words (other FAQs average 150 words)
- Generic "yes" response
- Misses opportunity to detail coastal challenges
- No examples or specifics
- Doesn't build local authority

**Recommended Rewrite (150+ words):**
```
Absolutely. Coastal property cleanouts are one of our specialties in Oceanside's marine environment. Ocean proximity creates unique junk removal challenges—salt air corrodes metal furniture and fixtures, creating rust that deteriorates patio sets, bicycles, and outdoor equipment faster than inland properties. We regularly remove salt-damaged items from harbor properties, beachfront homes along The Strand, and pier district vacation rentals. Storm debris removal becomes critical after winter weather systems bring heavy rain and coastal wind to Oceanside and North County beaches. We've handled numerous storm cleanup projects including damaged deck furniture, wind-blown debris, and flooding-related property damage near the harbor and low-lying coastal areas. King tides combined with winter storms occasionally cause minor flooding in harbor parking areas and beach-adjacent properties, requiring quick debris removal to prevent further damage. Our crews understand the specific challenges of coastal properties—sandy access routes, salt air corrosion, seasonal weather patterns, and the importance of protecting Oceanside's beaches and marine environment through responsible disposal. We coordinate with coastal property managers and HOAs familiar with these recurring issues.
