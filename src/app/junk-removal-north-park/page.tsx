                          University Avenue and 30th Street see heavy traffic during weekday commute hours (7-9 AM, 4-7 PM) as the neighborhood serves as a pass-through route between I-805 and downtown. Evening congestion intensifies Thursday-Saturday nights (7 PM-midnight) when the restaurant and bar scene peaks. We schedule most North Park services for mid-morning or early afternoon to avoid both commuter traffic and nightlife parking challenges.
