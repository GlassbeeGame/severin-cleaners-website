                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Poway's suburban layout and I-15 commuter traffic create predictable congestion patterns that affect <strong>junk hauling Poway</strong> timing. Our dispatch team actively monitors traffic conditions and coordinates with you to schedule service windows that work around commute hours and maximize efficiency:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                      <li><strong>Weekday commute hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM):</strong> Pomerado Road and Rancho Bernardo Road experience heavy I-15 commuter traffic as workers travel to/from San Diego and North County employment centers. We schedule early morning (6 AM start) or mid-day (10 AM-3 PM) service windows to avoid these peak periods, particularly for properties near freeway access points.</li>
                      <li><strong>Weekend family activity (Sat-Sun 9 AM-5 PM):</strong> Lake Poway, Old Poway Park, and hiking trailheads create recreational traffic on Community Road, Espola Road, and Highland Valley Road. For properties near these attractions, we recommend Sunday evening or weekday scheduling when trail parking lots and park facilities are less congested.</li>
                      <li><strong>School schedule impacts:</strong> Poway Unified School District operates on traditional calendar with concentrated September start and June finish. Back-to-school and summer transition periods create demand surges for garage organization and storage cleanouts. Book 2-3 weeks ahead during August-September and May-June for best availability.</li>
                      <li><strong>Rural property access:</strong> Ranch properties off Garden Road, Espola Road, and Highland Valley Road often have private driveways exceeding quarter-mile length. We coordinate advance arrival notifications and plan extra time for rural access. Equestrian properties require special coordination to avoid disturbing horses during feeding times (typically 6-8 AM and 4-6 PM).</li>
                    </ul>

                    {/* Weather */}
                    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Inland Climate Considerations</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                      Poway's inland location creates warmer, drier conditions compared to coastal San Diego neighborhoods. Summer temperatures (June-September) regularly exceed 85-90°F, making early morning or late afternoon scheduling preferable for both crew efficiency and client comfort during property walkthroughs. The warmer climate accelerates deterioration of outdoor storage items—sun-damaged patio furniture, heat-warped plastics, and dried-out wooden structures accumulate faster than in coastal areas, creating regular junk removal needs. Winter months (December-February) bring occasional heavy rainfall that can make unpaved rural driveways temporarily inaccessible, requiring schedule flexibility for ranch properties. Poway's dry heat also creates year-round fire season awareness—we prioritize rapid removal of accumulated brush, dead vegetation, and fire hazard materials to help homeowners maintain defensible space around properties, particularly in hillside and canyon interface areas near Blue Sky Reserve and Iron Mountain.
