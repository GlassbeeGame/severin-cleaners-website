              <p className="mb-4">
                Clairemont's mid-century homes present unique challenges - attached garages filled with decades of accumulation, attics with limited access, and floor plans that require careful navigation. Our team has extensive experience working in these classic 1950s-1970s properties, protecting original hardwood floors, maneuvering through narrow hallways, and accessing difficult storage spaces without damaging walls or doorframes.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We understand North Clairemont's hillside access challenges, South Clairemont's proximity to canyons and parks, and the Balboa Avenue corridor's mix of residential and commercial properties. Multi-generational households are common here, and we approach each project with patience and care - whether it's helping families downsize, clearing inherited properties, or simply reclaiming garage space that hasn't been used for parking in years.
              </p>
