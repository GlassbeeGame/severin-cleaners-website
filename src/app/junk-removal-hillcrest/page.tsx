                          University Avenue and Fifth Avenue see continuous traffic throughout weekdays as commuters use Hillcrest as a pass-through route between I-163 and I-805. Medical district shift changes (7 AM, 3 PM, 11 PM) create additional congestion near Washington Street and Front Street. Parking on Fifth Avenue is particularly challenging during lunch hours (11 AM-2 PM) and evening dining times (6-9 PM). We schedule most Hillcrest services for mid-morning or early afternoon to optimize parking access.
                        </p>

                          Interstate 163 access via Washington Street provides rapid downtown connections, though rush hour backups (7-9 AM southbound, 4-7 PM northbound) can impact service timing. Our crews monitor traffic patterns and use Park Boulevard or Fourth Avenue alternatives when freeway congestion occurs.
