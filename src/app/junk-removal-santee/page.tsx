              <p className="mb-4">
                Santee's suburban layout features large two-car garages that accumulate decades of storage - we specialize in garage cleanouts that reclaim parking space. Mission Gorge Road corridor properties have different needs than Fanita Ranch's newer developments or Riverview's hillside homes. Our team navigates Santee's growing traffic patterns, understands Carlton Hills Road access challenges, and knows which neighborhoods require HOA coordination versus direct scheduling.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                East County families often have boats, RVs, and outdoor equipment competing for garage space. Santee's warm climate means year-round outdoor projects creating debris. We handle everything from Costco-sized bulk purchases that didn't work out to complete property cleanouts for downsizing families. Our pricing accommodates both small garage organization projects and full estate clearances across Santee's diverse neighborhoods.
              </p>
