              <p className="mb-4">
                Lemon Grove's compact layout and dense housing create unique challenges - narrow streets, limited parking, and close-proximity neighbors. Our team knows how to navigate Broadway's tight residential streets, work efficiently in apartment complexes with limited loading areas, and coordinate around Lemon Grove Avenue traffic. We understand the neighborhood's mix of older homes and multi-unit properties.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Apartment turnovers require quick scheduling, small-scale pricing, and coordination with property managers. Older homes often have accumulated storage from decades of occupancy. We offer flexible appointment times, efficient service for smaller jobs, and understand the budget constraints that matter to working families. Our pricing structure accommodates both single-item pickups and full-home cleanouts.
              </p>
